1. Added a Field class, found the coordinates
2. Get a fuction that records Ayumu's posiiton when ayumuMoveDown
3. Compare that position with relevant Field positions
4. When the difference on those values is like <50, prevent movement in that relevant direction

5. After that, consider adding something like a shrinking box, or projectiles he has to dodge
6. Or even projectiles that push him around??
7. Or more simply, just geography he cant navigate

-- -- Side note, all of these problems run the risk of damaging the "cool" aesthetic

8. Thinking about letting him do hadokens or shoryukens
9. Y's style "battle" system?
